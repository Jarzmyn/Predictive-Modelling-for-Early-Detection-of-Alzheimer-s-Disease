# Predictive-Modelling-for-Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-Disease 🧠

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12-blue) 


This repository presents the development and evaluation of predictive models for the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using non-imaging clinical data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1 and OASIS-2) datasets. 

Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, and interpretability metrics such as confusion matrices, ROC curves and SHAP values. Notably, the Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high performance, with accuracy around 95.90% and AUC-ROC scores of 0.98.

Key clinical indicators, such as the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, were identified as critical predictors, reinforcing their established roles in dementia assessment. This study demonstrates that models relying solely on clinical data can match or exceed the performance of neuroimaging-based models, offering healthcare professionals a valuable tool for enhancing early AD detection strategies. Includes datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, training scripts, and documentation to enhance early diagnosis and intervention.
